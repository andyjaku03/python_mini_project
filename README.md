# python_mini_project
Mini Python Project for CS 102

The goal of this project is to create a program that will help inform a potential buyer/seller on the current prices of bitcoin. Assuming that the .csv file is continually updated, this python code can help visualize the prices of bitcoin for the user by showing its price throughout all its history, or by narrowing down the price of bitcoin into a range of recent days, which is determined by days from today. By entering the number of days from today that the user would like to see, they can access the: average, high, low, median, and standard deviation of bitcoin's price in that range of days. This will help them visualize trends in the price of bitcoin and ideally allow them to search for the prime opportunity to buy or sell the currency.
